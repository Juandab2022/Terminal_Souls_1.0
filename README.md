🎮 How the Game Works

The game runs in the console and is based on turns:

1. The player chooses an action.
2. The action is executed.
3. The enemy takes its turn automatically.
4. The process repeats until someone wins.

🤖 Enemy Behavior (AI)

The enemy acts automatically:

- Normally attacks dealing 15–20 damage.

Both the hero and the enemy have:

- A numeric HP value
